# MSC Trustgate Internship Portfolio

This repository contains the internship portfolio website developed during my placement at MSC Trustgate.com Sdn Bhd. The portfolio documents my contributions to the National Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Migration Plan and my involvement in the SB-PQC Sandbox initiative.

---

## Overview

The website highlights the key tasks, technical responsibilities, and industry engagements completed throughout the internship. The main focus areas include PQC algorithm integration, certificate authority simulation, benchmarking, certificate profiling, and secure key operations.

---

## 1. PQC Sandbox Development

I contributed to the development and testing of the SB-PQC Sandbox, a simulated Certificate Authority (CA) environment designed to evaluate PQC algorithms in a controlled setting. Tasks included:

- Implementing PQC certificate issuance workflows for Root, Intermediate, and End-Entity certificates.  
- Working with KAZ-SIGN, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA algorithms.  
- Verifying certificate chains and PQC signing/verification flows.  
- Ensuring compatibility with X.509 PKI standards.

---

## 2. Algorithm Benchmarking

I conducted benchmarking activities for PQC digital signature algorithms, focusing on:

- Key generation time  
- Signature generation and verification time  
- Public and private key size comparisons  
- Signature size comparisons  
- Preparing performance summaries for internal reporting

---

## 3. Certificate Profiles and PKI Configuration

I assisted in configuring PQC-aware certificate profiles, including:

- Document Signing, TLS, and Client Authentication profiles  
- Key Usage, Extended Key Usage (EKU), and Basic Constraints  
- Generating PEM and PKCS#12 (.p12) outputs  
- Ensuring profile alignment with RFC 5280 requirements

---

## 4. Integration with TGCA and Hardware Security Module (HSM)

During the internship, I gained exposure to integrating PQC operations with Trustgate’s CA engine and Hardware Security Module. This included:

- Understanding PKCS#11 interactions with HSM  
- Observing ML-DSA signing operations using hardware-backed private keys  
- Learning secure key storage principles in production CA environments
